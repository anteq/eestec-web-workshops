#### Thought 1
Usually client doesn't know what they want.

#### Thought 2
The requirements are constantly changing!
Note:
Imagine a project that takes a year to make. And imagine starting it in 2015. Don't you think that it would be useless right now? What was on top in 2015? Would you be able to predict what would be on top in 2017?

#### Thought 3
We can't measure complexity of software project until we actually work on it.

#### Thought 4
Plenty of work that has to be done is invisible.
Note:
Tests and stuff. When a physical artefact such as a bridge or road is being constructed the progress being made can actually be seen. With software, progress is not immediately visible.

How do we deal with that?

# Agile

Regular approach: **Waterfall**

New, *fancy* approach: **Agile**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
Note: 
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. They don't say "fuk u u r stupid", they value both.
