#### Git
# Why do we care?

You'll see it EVERYWHERE when doing something connected with IT.
Extremely important!

Yet some unis don't teach it properly. IDK why. :(

### A philosophical one:
### What makes program a program?

Source code. Duh.
Stored in files and folders.

#### Cooperation?
- take turns - you code today, I work on your version tomorrow  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- store your source code on Dropbox! - sure, but you'll override each other's changes  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- separate work on modules - I work on A, you work on B... but they will have to merge it sooner or later!  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- send scrapes of code via FB messenger - xDDD totally works  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- work on one another copies and patch it afterwards - you'll forget what you did a week ago.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
 
#### How do you make sure:
- you don't duplicate anyone's work? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- your code will work with someone else's? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Programmers are lazy. <br />
Engineers are lazy. <br />
People are lazy.
Note:
We don't want to do it manually.

Solution: Version Control System.

File is saved in the central **repository**.
Note:
draw it. Each one of them work on their working copy. What happens when they both edit? MERGE.

- No overwrites <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- No arguments <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Nothing is *ever* lost (infinite CTRL+Z)! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Also good to use even when working alone (history, segmentation etc.)

Not convinced?

Have you ever worked on a project and made a big change that broke EVERYTHING?
And you have no idea what you changed? :D

You need a server to store your files.
- Github  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Bitbucket  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Gitlab (self-hosted)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

You need git on your computer.
- sudo apt-get install git
- brew install git
- [... or for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Optional: GUI for Git

### Git
# Open source

Open source = you can see it, you can edit eat, you can do anything to it.
