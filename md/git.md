# Why do I care?

You'll see it EVERYWHERE when doing something connected with IT.
Extremely important!

Yet some unis don't teach it properly. IDK why. :(

# Why do we need it?

What makes program a program?

Source code. Duh.
Stored in files and folders.

Cooperation?
- take turns - you code today, I work on your version tomorrow
- store your source code on Dropbox! - sure, but you'll override each other's changes
- separate work on modules - I work on A, you work on B... but they will have to merge it sooner or later!
- send scrapes of code via FB messenger - xDDD totally works
- work on one another copies and patch it afterwards - you'll forget what you did a week ago.

How do you make sure:
- you don't duplicate anyone's work?
- your code will work with someone else's?

Programmers are lazy. <br />
Engineers are lazy. <br />
People are lazy.
Note:
We don't want to do it manually.

Solution: Version Control System.

File is saved in the central **repository**.
Note:
draw it. Each one of them work on their working copy. What happens when they both edit? MERGE.

- No overwrites
- No arguments
- Nothing is *ever* lost (infinite CTRL+Z)!

- Good to use even when working alone (history, segmentation etc.)

Not convinced?

Have you ever worked on a project and made a big change that broke EVRYTHING?
And you have no idea what you changed? :D
