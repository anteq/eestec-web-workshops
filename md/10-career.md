# Job possiblities

### Full-Stack Developer
- You can do everything.
- tools: Java, Python, Scala, JavaScript, (you-name-it)

### Back-end Developer/Engineer
- You make all the dirty work. You are the core of the system.
- tools: any programming language, SQL, Git, ...

### Front-end Developer/Engineer

### Front-end Developer/Engineer
AKA CSS/HTML Developer, Front-End Web Designer
- You work with the UI designer and 
- tools: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Git
Note:
relatively easy to start here

*Software Developer* vs *Software Engineer* vs *Programmer*
Note:
A programmer position is usually the one of a professional hired to to produce the code of a computer program. It will imply that you know how to write code, can understand an algorithm and follow specifications. However, it usually stops there in terms of responsibility.
A developer position is usually considered a super-type of the programmer position. It encompasses the same responsibilities, plus the ability to design and architect a software component, and to write the technical documentation for it (including specifications). You are able to - at least technically - lead others (so, programmers), but not necessarily a team (there comes the fuzz...)
An engineer position would usually imply that you are a developer who has a specific type of degree, some knowledge of engineering, and is capable of designing a system (as in: a combination of software components/modules that together form a whole software entity). Basically, you see a wider picture, and you are capable of designing and explaining it and separating it into smaller modules.

### UI Designer
- You make all these fancy graphics.
- tools: Photoshop, Sketch, ...

### UX Designer
AKA Interaction Designer (?)
- You set the interactions between the user and the app. You research how people use a site. 
- tools: brain, prototyping tools

### Network Engineer
- You ensure the communication between the computers.
- knowledge: web protocols, standards, both high-level and low-level stuff
- tools: Linux, enterprise routers, brain

### DevOps
- System Administrator. Makes sure that the rest of the team can work. That there's anything to work on.
- knowledge: possibly every layer of IT
- tools: Linux, Bash, Python, SQL,...
Note:
The job bridges the gap between IT and Developers. They handle things like server software, version control, deployment, build processes, and testing servers/processes. I wish this had a more job-title-y feeling to it. As it stands it sounds like what you would call the whole team of people with this job.

### Data Scientist
- Maintains the data and finds the patterns in it.
- knowledge: maths
- tools: R, Python, Matlab, SQL, brain

### Tech Support
- You are the expert in the platform that you support.

- tools: everything that neccessary
Note:
The IT consultant or specialist provides technical expertise to external clients, typically on a per-project or contract basis. The consultant may develop and implement IT systems, manage IT projects, provide after-sales support, or even develop code.

### Software Tester
- AKA: QA, test analyst
- Types: automatic, manual
- Tools: 

### Project Manager
- You make sure that people work on the project. You talk a lot.
- tools: Jira, calendars, larynx, ...

#### Career in IT
# Freelancing

### Starting? Maybe do some work for free?
Note:
Get started by working on ‘mini-projects’. Each project should have a well-defined objective. Learn what you need to achieve your objective for each project. That way, you’ll learn in manageable chunks, and have a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, which keeps you moving forward. It’s one of the best feelings!
Maybe volunteering?

### Focus on quality.
Note:
Take pride in your work. Keep your code neat and organized, but don’t try to ‘pre-optimize’. Just start writing, and clean as you go. It will help you immensely. Comment things as you learn them, so you can start remembering what things do.

### Ask for proper price for proper quality.
Note:
Start volunteering to do projects for others. You’ll start gaining real work experience, while simultaneously building your portfolio and professional network. This will prove invaluable when it’s time to apply for your first job.
Join a meetup. Check Meetup for local organizations, and attend meetups. Start building your network and find others to work with. Make friends and work on things together! Share knowledge, and help each other out. This is very important!
Don’t be discouraged. Programming requires a lot of patience, and the ability to learn on your own. I always think of myself as a professional student.

### Work on your portfolio.

### Embrace your network.

And when you'll already have clients...

### Time management is crucial!

### Do what you know how to do.

### Don’t take jobs that are too big.

### Avoid bad clients. You can afford it.

### You will get most business from referrals.

### Keep track of your time and bill regularly.

#### share some stuff

Some thoughts:
- it's good to set deadlines <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- make sure that the person responsible for the task knows the task <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- projects sometimes don't go the way that is planned <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- keeping the people motivated is a challenge!  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Remember:
Even for the hardest part in project management in IT is estimating the time for the task.

# Future 

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://media.giphy.com/media/piKXr2hEDsO1G/giphy.gif" -->
## What future has planned for you?
Note:
Można ich zapytać gdzie widzą się za 20 lat

## A programmer after 20 years of working
- High Level Manager?
- Company Management Department?
- Greenhorn Mentor?
- His own boss?
- Other IT field?

## But how does he find time to code?
### Easy - he doesnt! O.o

## We're only human after all
- You don't have to be awesome at everything
- You have the luxury of defining your own path by yourself

## Fear corpo career path
- Senior developer into IT Lead transition
- But not everybody has Leader qualities
# Outcome:
It's quite common to be thrown into doing things you don't have to be good at

## Not being on Manager seat can also be fullfilling
