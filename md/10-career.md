## How about a little predisposition test?
Note:

## Movie time
 ![fimlik na yt o kwadratach ze ścieżkami kariery]()

## Are you too young to work?
- You are students
- You are young
- You are free (almost)
Note:
Jesteśmy tanią siłą roboczą ale możemy to wykorzystać na naszą korzyść
Firmy chcą w nas inwestować więc im pozwólmy

## Finishing your education might be profitable:
- things you can experience as a student
- learn for somebody else's money :)
- start your professional career with experience in your field

## You don't like your current job? Don't be afraid to change it for a different one!

### Web(Platform 9 3/4) Dev
- relatively easy to begin with
- creativelly repetetive
- probably easiest way in - Frontend

#### Career in IT
# Future 

## What future has planned for you?
Note:
Można ich zapytać gdzie widzą się za 20 lat

## Antek after 20 years of working
- High Level Manager?
- Company Management Department?
- Greenhorn Mentor?
- His own boss?
- Other IT field?

## But how does he find time to code?
### Easy - he doesnt! O.o

## We're only human after all
- You don't have to be awesome at everything
- You have the luxury of defining your own path by yourself

## Fear corpo carrer path
- Senior developer into IT Lead transition
- But not everybody has Leader qualities
# Outcome:
It's quite common to be thrown into doing things you don't have to be good at

## Not being on Manager seat can also be fullfilling
