## API

API = Application Programming Interface

API is nothing more than a method to access data and workflow from an application without using an application itself

it's like blackboxing - you're only interested about the input and the output and you don't care about how it works really

## Sample?

Eg. Facebook without Like API and with Like API

----

How does that relate to Programming?

## Interfaces (in programming)


----

Imagine, how should we structure such API?

E.g. Facebook
User may want to:
- add post
- get posts on wall

## Exercise
Try to imagine  how such API would work?

----

How do we use it?

On the other hand... how do we make sure that API is not a mess?

# REST 
no, we won't xdd

REST = REpresentational State Transfer

## Level 1
Resources
- organize your data in endpoints

## Level 2
CRUD also known as HTTP verbs
- add methods to this endpoints

## Level 3
### HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)
Note:
The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

----

On the other hand... how do we make sure that we understand the language that we speak?

## Data format
Why not completely random?
It has to be structured!
XML, JSON, etc...


----

On the other hand... how do we make communication live?
- websockets

----

On the other hand... how this can be related to 0010010?
ISO/OSI
## Client-Server
